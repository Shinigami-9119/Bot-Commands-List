This is the current command list for Aroma Bot.

Important Stuff You Should Know:
--------------------------------

1. Aroma Bot primarily uses the command character `-`.
2. `[ ]` text enclosed in brackets means that it is a necessary argument/option, and must be specified **always**.
3. `( )` text enclosed in parenthesis means that it is optional, and the command would work regardless it was specified or not, albeit in a different manner, to be more specific, it'd resort to the _default_ options.
4. All of the commands mentioned below are to be **preceded by `-`**, for Aroma Bot to recognize them as commands.
5. Credit to Sparkychild for the bot and Dragotic, AFlyingPhantom and Alpha Ninja for the help in learning and making most commands work.
